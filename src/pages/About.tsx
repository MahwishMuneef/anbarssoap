        <p>
          Pure Botanica began with a simple belief: skincare should be gentle, honest, and beautiful. We craft small batches using
          clean, plant-powered ingredientsâ€”no noise, no shortcuts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our minimalist approach celebrates fewer, better essentials. Each bar and wash is made to calm, nourish, and support your
          skin barrier. Thoughtful sourcing, recyclable packaging, and mindful production guide everything we do.
